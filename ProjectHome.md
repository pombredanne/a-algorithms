This project acts as source code repository about various algorithms used by the author.

1. K-means++ in Python. It can be compiled in standard Python (in Eclipse) and IronPython (Python for .NET)

2. Two multiple-pattern exact string matching algorithms in C#. The first one is created by Anton Andreev and it is based on a "hashing window". The second is Aho Corasick which builds a kind of automation. The test code shows that the Aho Corasick is faster.

3. C# code that calculates k nearest neighbor by using a kd-tree for faster computations.

4. C# implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for matching customers and products.

5. C# machine learning code sample that combines Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multilayer Perceptron(MLP).
